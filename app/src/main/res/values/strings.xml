Choose who goes first  You can decide randomly or just alternate each new game.  Alternating turns  The first player will place his symbol (X or O) on any empty square on the board. Then, the second player will place his symbol (O or X) on an empty square. Players continue to alternate turns until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.  Winning conditions  A player wins if he manages to place three of his symbols in a row, column or diagonal on the board.
